The figure below explains the idea of a taxonomy as bridge between human and
machine understanding of data. It is important to focus on a specific domain to
get common understanding and acceptance. The link between two or more domain
taxonomies can be seen as second step.

## Components of a domain taxonomy
A domain taxonomy, like VSS, consists of three important components, which will be
discussed in detail in this documentation:

**1. Rule Set**, as definition on how to describe the data definition syntactically.

**2. Data Definition**, as description of the domain as a simple graph.

**3. Tools and Serialization**, generates the serialization out of the data Definition
   for further usage.
